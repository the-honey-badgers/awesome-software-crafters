This page is intended as a guide to learn the values, practices and techniques that make an awesome Software Crafter.

## Disclaimer

This guide is mainly inspired in the experience that the members of The Honey Badgers Tribe gained when they first worked as a team, back in 2016. We believe that trust is the core value of a great team. We believe that focus on communication, knowledge-sharing and learning is what makes a great Software Crafter, Developer or Engineer. The guide is a reflection of this ideas, for we firmly believe that this culture creates better working environments, better teams and better products.
